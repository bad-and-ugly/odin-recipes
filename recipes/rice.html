        <h2>Plain white rice</h2>
        <p>Just your good old regular rice to complement your beans. This recipe will serve four people but you can keep the proportion to make more or less of it.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of white rice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of oil</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
            <li>1 bayleaf (optional)</li>
            <li>2 cups of water (more or less)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the rice. This will get rid of excess starch.</li>
            <li>Chop the garlic</li>
            <li>Add the oil to a medium pan on low heat. Add the garlic and the bayleaf and braise them briefly.</li>
            <li>Add the rice to the pan and braise it a little - just mix it well, you want the garlic and oil to get to the rice.</li>
            <li>Add enough water to cover the rice.</li>
            <li>Add a three-fingered pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with the lid, but only halfway. You don't want too much steam to gather in the pan, nor for the water to dry too quickly.</li>
            <li>Cook until the water dries. Careful not to burn it!</li>
        </ol>
