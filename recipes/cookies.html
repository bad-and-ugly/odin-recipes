        <h2>1-2-3 cookies: easy as 1, 2, 3!</h2>
        <p>These are the easiest cookies you'll make and you'll see why they're called 123. Just one part of sugar, two of butter, three of flour and you're all ready to go!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>300 g of flour</li>
            <li>200 g of butter</li>
            <li>100 g of sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180Â° C</li>
            <li>Add the flour, the butter and the sugar to a large bowl and mix them well. Use your hands.</li>
            <li>Once you have a soft dough, roll it like a salame and slice it thin. Another option is to roll it into balls and then press each ball to flatten it.</li>
            <li>Anoint a large baking pan with butter and put the disks of though on it.</li>
            <li>Let it bake for 20 min. Let it cool before you serve it - it will still be soft right out of the oven, but gets crunchy as it cools.</li>
        </ol>
